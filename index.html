<p class="abstract"><em>Abstract:</em> <p>Songs in Isolation is a series
of nine mini-works for online multimedia distribution. The works are a
time capsule of the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Each piece
was informed by Melbourne, Australia's global and locational
socio-political contexts. Composition themes include frustration (at
public messaging, government incompetence, panic buying, lobbying by
large businesses at the detriment of the rest of society, and spreading
of disinformation), socially contagious behaviours (home hairdressing,
meditation, dieting), and personal reactions to stress (brain fog,
dissociation, pressure to generate creative content). This research is
practice-based performative autoethnography [1], [2]. The pieces and
social context move together, buffeted by the movements of a virus and
the success or failure of each country concerning travel movements and
location-specific behaviours of the public. Various composition tools
and techniques were used to suit each work, including gestural
interfaces (Wave [3], MiMu [4], self-built datagloves – GLVD [5]),
consumer EEG interface – Muse 2 [6]), various DAWs and field recording
devices, and voice.</p></p>

class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p><em>Songs in Isolation</em> is a series of works composed during the
2020-2021 COVID-19 lockdowns in Melbourne, Australia. The pieces were a
response and documentation process for current events, public waves of
consciousness (anxiety, apathy, bread-making, et cetera), and the
importance of maintaining one’s practice during isolation. The works use
various tools, such as human interface devices (HID) – consumer EEG
(Electro-encephalogram) device <em>Muse 2</em> [6], self-built dataglove
gestural controllers (GLVD); and digital workstation tools such as
<em>Max</em> [7], <em>Ableton Live 11</em> [8], <em>Logic Pro X</em>
[9]. Audio sources included field recordings, sampling, and human voice
using <em>Extended Vocal Techniques</em> (EVT). EVT are singing
techniques drawn from contemporary, experimental, and non-Western
styles. These techniques are part of my practice and exploration as a
singer-composer-performer and are my primary choice for artistic
expression. Each piece is a work of performative autoethnography and was
informed by embodiment studies and body-centric practices.</p>
<p>COVID-19 created a dividing barrier between the world before and the
world after. Social contagion was a benign manifestation alongside the
viral contagion concerns. Behavioural contagion gave individuals a sense
of connection during a period of isolation in addition to fear-based and
emotional contagions as social phenomena (panic buying and hoarding of
toilet paper and other grocery goods, for example). These positive and
negative aspects spread through the internet [10]. Through our physical
separation, many attempted to remain connected via social media. This
facsimile of social connection was a potential super spreader for
behavioural trends, magnifying the normal engagement through a
heightened sense of fear and anxiety driven by the global pandemic.</p>
<p>In this paper, I discuss social contagion during viral contagion
through COVID-19 artworks and the echoes of actions throughout society.
I was affected by behavioural contagion and discussed my works in the
context of each work’s current events and as compared to songs that
became viral memes during the early stages of the pandemic. This work is
limited to my experiences and reactions to global phenomena. Perspective
is often granted through distance to the initial catalyst, particularly
in traumatic situations, as the COVID-19 pandemic has been for many
people. How do COVID-centric artworks bear witness to time, place, and
space? This research addresses these questions by looking at works
through an outward lens on social contagions [11], [12].</p>
<h1 class="First-Level-Headings" data-number="2" id="methodology"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Methodology</h1>
<p>This research is practice-based [1] autoethnography [2]. The pieces
and the writing are told through a personal lens, commenting on the
broader societal landscape and responding to COVID-19, political events,
and social issues. Understanding and interpreting the world through
making is central to my practice. Sullivan [13] describes knowing in the
arts as a braid-like structure, where the strands must be continuously
unwoven, sorted, and re-constructed through various existing practices
and enquiries. The pieces and social context move together, buffeted by
the movements of a virus and the success or failure of each country with
travel movements and location-specific behaviours of the public.</p>
<p>My pieces serve as vehicles to explore social contagion, personal
experiences, and global phenomena. I experiment and innovate with
techniques, audio effects, and technologies, externalising personal
experiences. Furthermore, I employ body movements and brainwave data to
control sound generation, turning my body into an artistic interface.
Drawing heavily from personal experiences and reactions to events, I
acknowledge my perspectives and biases, reflecting on how these
experiences inform artistic choices and the embedded meaning in my
work.</p>
<p>I use various wearable technologies and computer-based composition
tools to create the pieces. These devices are pivotal, as my approach is
significantly influenced by the tools used. Due to the importance of the
body and perceptions as integral components in the research, I have
drawn from embodiment [14], [15] due to its body-centric approach.
Embodiment, in straightforward terms, is the study of the interplay
between the body, brain, and objects in action. The composition
experiments were accompanied by a reflective journal containing
work-session reflections (intuitions, perceptions, techniques, analysis,
methods used, and health state). Each work was completed with a video
clip, uploaded to YouTube, and débuted at a SeenSound event (a monthly
sound and audio event run by Brigid Burke and Mark Pedersen in
Melbourne, Australia). Compositions were inspired by current events,
principally location-driven by Melbourne, Australia. However, the
heavily online nature of general life currently means a significant
cross-pollination from other countries.</p>
<h2 class="Second-Level-Headings unnumbered"
id="location-context">Location Context</h2>
<p>Living through Melbourne's COVID-19 lockdowns significantly
influenced my experience and that of my social circles during the early
pandemic stages. Initially, the Victorian government adopted a more
relaxed approach but later shifted towards stricter measures, which some
viewed as draconian. Personally, I hesitate to label them as such, as I
witnessed rule-breaking in my neighbourhood and through news articles
that painted a different picture. Instead, these restrictions seemed to
reflect a pessimism about society's commitment to collective well-being,
questioning Australia's deeply ingrained “mateship” values.</p>
<p>While Melbourne was relatively safe from high infection and death
rates compared to other global regions, the consequences of political
and societal failures were still challenging to endure. Families in
Australia were spared much COVID-related grief, but mental health
issues, particularly among women in Victoria, escalated [16], [17].
Additionally, traditional gender roles were reinforced during the
pandemic, with women taking on most of the added responsibilities in
housework and childcare [18].</p>
<h1 class="First-Level-Headings" data-number="3"
id="behavioural-contagion"><span class="header-section-number">3</span>
Behavioural Contagion</h1>
<p>Behavioural contagion is a form of social contagion. These can be
malignant or benign; for example, behavioural and social contagion is
thought to be a factor in mass murders, suicide clusters, fads, and
viral internet memes<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> [19]. Some examples of viral musical
audiovisual memes were the <em>Coronavirus Etude</em> [20] and <em>Get
on the Beers</em> [21]. Examples of behavioural contagion through social
media transmitted fads include the home salon (cutting and dying hair at
home), baking bread (especially sourdough bread), and panic buying.</p>
<p>It is thought that an explanation for social contagion may be the
“memetic stance because culture has an independent evolutionary dynamic
that is derived from the genetically evolved human capacity and
predisposition to replicate culture” [19, p. 50]. Marsden discusses the
success of social contagions being determined by stimulus and response
in evoking imitation. The internet provides easy access to both stimulus
and response-giving for individuals and groups.</p>
<p>The internet is considered a weak tie in social contagion. However,
it has further reach due to the length of the tie and network
possibilities. Centola discusses how “networks with long, narrow bridges
are useful for spreading information” but cautions that “too much
randomness can be inefficient for spreading the social reinforcement
necessary to act on that information” as risk and/or connectedness
decline [10, p. 731].</p>
<p>Since some works are responses to, and adoptions of, social and
behavioural contagion, I have sought to critique (at the time) current
events as a pseudo-pandemic diary. Some works are more lighthearted and
whimsical to cope with ever-pressing global concerns. The pieces become
thematically darker as time and circumstances wore on. This climaxes in
the ninth piece (or the last muse), where this work diverges into my
doctoral thesis and presentations of trauma as a composition tool to
externalise psychological states.</p>
<h1 class="First-Level-Headings" data-number="4"
id="the-nine-muses"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> The
Nine Muses</h1>
<p>Here, I discuss the compositions relevant to this paper and how they
represent the global or local context at the time of composition. The
series is collectively called <em>Songs in Isolation</em>. The works are
discussed in the order composed and released. Links to YouTube videos
are provided for each piece.</p>
<h2 class="Second-Level-Headings unnumbered"
id="i-always-read-the-instructions-april-may-2020">I: Always Read the
Instructions, April-May 2020</h2>
<p>This responds to the early 2020 trend of dying one’s hair and chaotic
government communications about the pandemic. It uses speech, video, and
audio effects created in Logic Pro X [9]. The audio was recorded during
hair dyeing while delivering a perky, YouTube tutorial-style address,
paralleling the process of dying one’s hair to creating art in lockdown
and upholding traditional productivity.</p>
<p>A theme of the pandemic has been globally mixed messaging concerning
health recommendations. In early 2020, the news was flooded with
opinions expressed as facts and insane medical advice was being spread
by prominent political figures and conspiracy theorists alike.
Uncertainty prevailed, and DIY haircare surged.</p>
<p>The layered and glitchy audio elements symbolise
information-disinformation cycles, medical recommendations filtered
through social media, and lockdown-induced hysteria. Text lines like “In
isolation, you really have to focus on solo projects” and “Always read
the instructions first” satirise the pressures imposed by workplaces,
governments, corporations, and universities for continued productivity
and consumption. These statements are juxtaposed with facial expressions
conveying grimaces, uncertain twitches, and sighs, further accentuated
through audio manipulation techniques within a Digital Audio Workstation
(DAW), resulting in glitching sounds.</p>

<h2 class="Second-Level-Headings unnumbered"
id="ii-easing-restrictions-june-2020">II: Easing Restrictions, June
2020</h2>
<p>This piece draws on the use of language, voice, and layering from
Mark Applebaum’s <em>Three Unlikely Corporate Sponsorships</em> [22]
series. It responds to the untimely easing of COVID-19 restrictions in
Australia in June 2020, contrasting with New Zealand's cautious
approach. I saw mixed reactions on social media, with some enthusiastic
about returning to “normal” and others more cautious and sceptical.</p>
<p>I formed a score by stacking text layers in a word processor and
recording each layer using a low-quality headset microphone to emulate
early computer conferencing call quality. The text’s position on the
page in the text score informed the pitch centre of each line’s
delivery. The audio was processed with audio effects to separate the
layers sonically.</p>
<p>Text sources included social media themes like lockdown weight loss,
supermarket shortages, opinions on easing restrictions, and snippets
from news conferences on platforms such as the Australian Broadcasting
Company (ABC). Like Applebaum, employed speech rhythms and pitches to
shape the music deliberately in a playful manner.</p>

<h2 class="Second-Level-Headings unnumbered"
id="iii-umm-omm-july-2020">III: Umm… Omm?, July 2020</h2>
<p>This piece extends my EVT and throat-singing practice from my
master’s degree, investigating how physical and virtual locations affect
voice use. I composed it in response to social media’s renewed emphasis
on meditation and creating peaceful environments during Melbourne's
second significant lockdown in July. I made layers of voice, using
overtone (filtering vocal formants by control of the tongue, oropharynx,
and nasopharynx) and undertone (period doubling the fundamental pitch
with the false vocal folds) singing. The initial layer draws inspiration
from the syllable “Om”, commonly associated with meditation and yoga in
Indian religions. The piece features minimal harmonic movement but
shifting overtones and fundamentals, creating an unresolved space with
subtle tension that builds throughout and eventually fades without
musical resolution.</p>
<p>The goal was to craft a pseudo-meditation piece that offers a
tranquil yet somewhat edgy sonic environment, stepping beyond
genre-specific boundaries. That is, the lack of traditional harmony and
an increased dissonance in note selection. The intentionally short
duration prematurely disrupts established meditation music
parameters.</p>

<h2 class="Second-Level-Headings unnumbered"
id="iv-fuzzylogic-september-2020">IV: FuzzyLogic, September 2020</h2>
<p>This piece responds to the heightening of my brain fog, amplified by
my doctoral project and the challenge of maintaining a positive educator
role amidst recurring anti-lockdown protests [23]. This étude was also
used for my doctoral thesis to test <em>Muse 2</em> (a consumer EEG
device) as an embodied sound controller and alternative to glove-based
gesture control. The title blends logic theory, its commonplace
association with washing machine ads, mundane existence, cognitive
fuzziness (brain fog), and the distortion control symbolism in
translating my brain waves into real numbers between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Using voice and <em>Muse 2, (Figure 1)</em>, I yoked delta, theta,
alpha, beta, and gamma brain waves via OSC (Open Sound Control) from an
iPad and a secondary application, routing them into <em>Max</em> [7].
Each brain wave type controlled a distinct sound source. One vocal layer
encompassed “ah” sounds with and without vocal fry (isolated vocal fold
air pops) and an undertone. The accompanying video was generated by
recording the device's output while listening to the final
composition.</p>

id="v-being-inside-october-2020">V: Being Inside, October 2020</h2>
<p>This piece was inspired by the relentless dripping of the bathroom
sink and shower taps, neglected by our landlords for years. Melbourne
was on the cusp of reopening, with each day aching for reconnection with
friends and family amidst the monotonous daily grind. To counter this
sameness, I resorted to haircuts for a change. Dripping taps are
universally irksome and have been employed as a torture method, notably
known as Chinese water torture [24].</p>
<p>I used <em>Max</em>, <em>Ableton Live</em>, <em>GLVD</em> (version
three, with gestures: fist, palm, peace sign, and pinky out, see
<em>Figure 2</em>) and one hand manually controlled volumes on a second
MIDI controller. Due to CPU intensity issues stemming from an
unoptimised <em>GLVD</em> version three <em>Max</em>-patch device
interface, I employed a single glove to mitigate the computing load.
Unlike my other works, this piece does not feature voice; I used the
vibrating drone of hair clippers and reverb to enhance overtones,
mimicking the effect achieved with vocals.</p>

id="vi-first-there-was-nothing-then-it-exploded-october-2021">VI: First,
There Was Nothing, Then It Exploded, October 2021</h2>
<p>This work uses voice and <em>GLVD</em>, version three; see <em>Figure
2</em>. It combines serendipity, flow, and a sonic explosion. As
Melbourne inched towards easing most COVID-19 restrictions,
transitioning into “COVID-normal” rules [25]. The hayfever season
coincided with this prolonged lockdown, causing a sense of temporal and
future disorientation. This composition briefly provided solace.</p>
<p>A sudden data glitch unexpectedly intensified the self-made filter
effect in <em>Max</em> and reverb, resulting in a sonic explosion akin
to a missile detonation. I controlled this audio through the roll
position of my right wrist. The intermittent synth line emerged from my
moments of distraction (while keeping the other hand still) while
grappling with the substantial, distorted noise. The noise initially
erupted chaotically but gradually evolved into a structured sound that I
could control. This revelation brought the sound almost to silence, a
choice I briefly regretted before reigniting the noise. I became
consumed by the interaction but became self-conscious and halted the
noise, believing I had spent over 10 minutes engrossed in the activity.
This unexpected shift in time perception and the sound's engulfing
quality resulted in a temporal disconnection, aligning with
’<em>flow’</em> and embodiment concepts [26], [27]. The engagement was
captivating due to its element of surprise and initial
unpredictability.</p>
<p>I opted to preserve the glitch unaltered to capture the depth of my
immersion in the activity, while the synth and speech segments leading
up to and following the glitch were edited to frame and document the
glitch. These segments were layered and panned in the final mix.</p>

id="vii-mood2020-october-2020-january-2021">VII: Mood:2020, October 2020
– January 2021</h2>
<p>This piece, a collaborative effort with Little Songs of the Mutilated
under the coordination of Justin Ashworth, involved around 42
participants from a collective of over 120 individuals. Each participant
contributed a sample of five seconds or less, and the guidelines were
simple: create a piece with a duration ranging from three to fifteen
minutes, using at least 90% of the sounds from the shared sample
database. I integrated 17 of these samples, including my
contribution.</p>
<p>I organised these samples into blocks by editing and combining
multiple samples. Then, employing GLVD version four (Figure 3), I
generated layers of sound by controlling the speed, pitch, and audio
effects on each sample block. Takes were performed, curated, and stacked
to construct the final composition<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Its inspiration stemmed from one sample’s name, “<em>MOOD20</em>”. At
the time, I found humour in the track name, reflecting my crankiness,
confinement, and weariness of lockdown and winter. Much like a
disgruntled parent would put it, I was in a “mood”. This emotion seemed
to resonate with the prevailing sentiment in Melbourne when I began
crafting the piece.</p>

id="viii-flame-february-2021">VIII: Flame, February 2021</h2>
<p>This piece uses breath, field recordings, and a lighter. It was
written in response to being told of the terminal illness of a friend
that was left to fester during COVID-19, renewed urges to ease
restrictions unwisely, anti-vaccination protests, vaccination rollout
bungles, wimpy climate change action by the Australian government, poor
handling of sexual assault in Australian workplaces, and confused aid
requirements amid smaller scale lockdowns in Victoria, Australia. This
composition marks a shift away from the intense emotional and
behavioural connections experienced during the initial COVID-19 lockdown
periods, representing mounting frustrations arising from inaction,
complacency, and the repetitiveness of these experiences.</p>
<p>Breath and lighter flicking samples accompany each other and interact
with field recordings and natural bush sounds captured at Organ Pipes
National Park, VIC, in January 2021. The breath sounds reinforce the
bird songs and fire crackles, acting as the gas flows through the
lighter with soft whistles, inhales, exhales, and other mouth noises.
Rhythmic inhales and exhales, occasionally intertwined with subtle
inward phonation, create a subdued climax in the composition,
symbolising Australia’s governmental conservation apathy.</p>

id="ix-your-subconscious-is-knocking-pt.-1-september-2021">IX: Your
Subconscious is Knocking, Pt. 1, September 2021</h2>
<p>This piece encapsulates the lingering impact of COVID lockdowns, the
traumatic experiences facilitated by the altered communication dynamics
of the COVID era, and the escalating prevalence of gender-based online
abuse [28]–[30]. During traumatic events described in the concealed text
(layer 1), my brain underwent transient amnesia (dissociation), erasing
the trauma details and leaving only the lingering symptoms. Dissociation
arises when the brain becomes overwhelmed and temporarily disconnects
from a situation, leading to brief or extended periods of
detachment.</p>
<p>This composition comprises two layers and was crafted using
<em>Max</em> and voice. The first layer features text-driven noise that
recounts an abusive situation I endured from 2020 to 2021, primarily
unfolding through an online platform. The noise gate allows sound to
pass through when the text is spoken. The second layer becomes audible
during instances of “Shh” and breath or mouth sounds (this second noise
gate operates similarly to the first). The second layer interacts with
the first, causing a reduction in the first layer's sound.</p>
<p>The recurring “Shh” symbolises moments of disconnection within my
brain, while the initial, quieter tonal noise represents my experience —
my subconscious and body attempting to communicate. When the shushing
takes precedence over the first layer, it imitates the momentary
dissociation of a besieged mind. The various “Shh” iterations reflect
the brain’s capacity for effective self-censorship with varying degrees
of intensity.</p>

<h1 class="First-Level-Headings" data-number="5" id="discussion"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>During the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in
Melbourne, we craved human connections despite physical distancing. We
sought virtual unity through trends, collective emotions, social media,
and digital conferences. We spent much time plodding through life and on
video-conferencing calls. I intended to document these shared
experiences sonically – down to the home hairdressing trends, pets
wandering in front of the camera during meetings, and toilet paper
shortages creating a pandemic diary. The resulting works reveal a theme
of online contagion and offer social commentary on issues amplified
through viral transmission, which I explore through proximity,
contagion, play, and humour.</p>
<h2 class="Second-Level-Headings unnumbered"
id="proximity-and-contagion">Proximity and Contagion</h2>
<p><em>Songs in Isolation</em> acts as a time capsule and commentary on
early pandemic experiences, reflecting our collective sense of anxiety
and responses. These were our collective angst. Many individuals
maintain social connections through social media and platforms such as
Zoom. Each work demonstrates a facet of the COVID-19 experience.
Surprisingly, earlier works demonstrate a greater unification with the
cultural zeitgeist than later works. This could be due to the easing of
restrictions providing a social outlet. By piece eight, more pressing
matters became evident from COVID-19 for my social circle and me, so our
experiences diverged.</p>
<p>These initial emotional shifts and engagements in trending activities
illustrate examples of convergence or emotional contagion, likely
influenced by empathy and the mirror neuron system<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
[31] [32]. Research shows that emotional contagion is driven by empathy,
a quality generally found to be higher among artists [33]. When I was
filled with grief for the death of my previous life, other people were
in a similar space, and then when I moved through it, they would have
done too. Even in physical isolation, emotions appeared to travel
through digital communications.</p>
<p>Different reactions to upheaval fuelled trends, driven by factors
such as boredom, minor acts of rebellion, the so-called Lipstick
Effect<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> [34], a desire for community through
shared activities, and heightened anxiety. For instance, panic buying, a
socially undesirable herd behaviour, emerged due to perceived threats
and product scarcity, influenced by an individual’s social network and
the need for control in a situation where one felt helpless [35], [36].
Another noteworthy thread was the compulsion to change one’s appearance
[32], [34], particularly evident in the surge of DIY haircare
facilitated by the sudden unavailability of salon appointments. Beyond
my normal predilection for DIY, I could control my public-facing
response through creative works documenting my experience. These
compositions aimed to inject humour and light-heartedness into the
pandemic narrative, using emotional contagion to relieve the general
stress of living through a pandemic.</p>
<p>Each work in <em>Songs in Isolation</em> deals with a different
emotional wave. Earlier works exhibit a tongue-in-cheek approach to
social and mental health phenomena. The sonic textures remain
aesthetically consistent between pieces. I generally used low-budget
technology and rapid composition turnarounds to authentically capture
evolving events. A downside is the lack of predictable structure in
intervals between compositions. More reliable trends might have been
captured in one piece every two to four weeks. Regularly generating and
sharing works online increases the likelihood of algorithmic
recognition. However, this added pressure might result in stilted work,
burnout, and a lack of relevance as trends fluctuate.</p>
<p>Notably, some prominent pandemic trends, like bread baking and toilet
paper shortages, are not featured in these compositions. Conversely,
albeit subtly incorporated, panic buying reflects toilet paper's
unpredictable availability in my local supermarket, for example, in
<em>Easing Restrictions</em>. Toilet paper remains an item that is
inconsistently available in my local supermarket. However, these were
trends that I and my household avoided during the main lockdowns for
various reasons. The home salon trend paralleled my usual, non-COVID
life. This allowed easy integration into the creative process as the
regularity of haircuts and hair dye meant that I could engage during my
normal routine. This contributed positively to the internet's weak tie
effect in social contagion, lowering the entry barrier.</p>
<p>Some of the inspiration for these compositions stems from darker
experiences, such as the connection between <em>Your Subconscious is
Knocking</em> and the theme of abuse, all linked by the profound sense
of isolation and trauma. These thematically darker works are handled
more seriously, collectively revealing a downward trend in mental health
and emotional resources. They serve as snapshots of moments when I
experienced increasing social isolation, in stark contrast to others
becoming less restricted, thus documenting the detrimental effects of
prolonged government-mandated isolation.</p>
<h2 class="Second-Level-Headings unnumbered" id="play-and-humour">Play
and Humour</h2>
<p>Humour, particularly dark humour, is often used as a crutch when we
deal with difficult circumstances<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> [37]. In not using overt
sonic aggression cues (except for distortion in <em>Fuzzy Logic</em>),
the emotional tone of the pieces is kept light. Even <em>Always Read the
Instructions</em>, <em>Your Subconscious is Knocking, pt.1</em>, and
<em>First There Was Nothing, Then It Exploded</em> with their glitchy,
shaped noise, emphasise tonality and timbre. They achieve this by
juxtaposing absurd elements like an overly cheerful speaking voice,
librarian shushing, and unconventional synthesizer lines.</p>
<p>Other absurd elements the mundanity of everyday lives, featuring
elements like a cat sample in <em>Mood:2020</em>, recurring home
hairdressing themes, and text content in <em>Easing Restrictions</em>.
They also document the waves of larger social consciousness, albeit
through the lens of an individual’s biases<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. By
framing my work through nonsensical and surreal depictions of news,
emotions, and trends, I aim to offer a humorous perspective. This
approach cloaks potentially distressing emotions, presenting them as
subjects for light-hearted amusement rather than expressing them with
excessive distortion or anger.</p>
<p>The confinement of endless Zoom calls and restricted outdoor
activities triggered a sense of entrapment. To counter this, I embraced
novel instruments for musical expression, such as the <em>GLVD</em>, and
repurposed devices like <em>Muse 2</em> in a playful manner. These novel
instruments facilitated embodied interactions with sound, a subject I
continue exploring in my doctoral thesis. Embodiment and one’s
connection to the body can be disrupted through traumatic situations by
the individual’s conscious or unconscious distancing from emotions and
anxiety as somatic consequences. This research is beyond the scope of a
single article.</p>
<p>As a summary of ongoing research, novel physical interaction with
sound manipulation and sound creation changes my sonic output to
explorations of timbre and physically generated manipulations. This
functionally means often using continuous controls rather than stepped
controls. This shift and incorporation of the whole body in the creative
process disrupted my conventional practice as a singer and
multi-instrumentalist. It gave a positive reason to engage with computer
music after long workdays and provided release through the creative
process. Moreover, it prompted adjustments in my performance goals,
emphasising grace and the delicate balance of being a singer, dancer,
and accompanist, reigniting my involvement in dance as an art form with
its distinct bodily demands. This experience informs my future research,
particularly exploring the development of proprioceptive skills and
aesthetics in gestural performance, building upon Mainsbridge's work
[38].</p>
<h2 class="Second-Level-Headings unnumbered"
id="technologies-impacts">Technologies’ Impacts</h2>
<p>Quick turnarounds for most pieces led me to use whatever was readily
available in addition to my doctoral research on wearable and embodied
interfaces. This sometimes resulted in a low-budget approach, reflecting
the shift to home devices compared to professional setups. Musicians,
including professionals, students, and amateurs, often faced a reduction
in the quality of their tools during the pandemic. As mentioned in
<em>Easing Restrictions</em>, these lower-quality devices were used
intentionally to colour and code the recordings towards this
purpose.</p>
<p>I used Zoom H1 and H5 devices in field recordings. I preferred the H1
for its portability, minimal mental effort, and convenience (powered by
a single AA battery). This cost-effective choice streamlined
decision-making, mirroring the reduction in choices imposed by
Melbourne’s strict curfews. I prioritised devices with low cognitive
demands, reflecting and paralleling the pandemic’s emotional toll,
financial strain, and Zoom fatigue, characterised by eye strain,
constant self-monitoring, reduced mobility, frozen positions, and
heightened cognitive load compensating for diminished non-verbal
communication [39], [40].</p>
<h1 class="First-Level-Headings" data-number="6" id="conclusions"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusions</h1>
<p>COVID-19 continues to shape our lives, as are online platforms and
contagious behaviours. <em>Songs in Isolation</em> addresses the
enduring impact of COVID-19 on our lives, particularly interrogating
these contagions. These compositions serve as a sonic diary,
encapsulating collective trauma and my personal experience during the
first 18 months of the pandemic. Comprising nine distinct works, each
captures specific moments shaped by global and local socio-political
contexts, primarily Melbourne, Australia. The topics encompass
frustrations with public messaging, government competence, panic buying,
corporate lobbying, and the spread of disinformation. Though I used
quick turnarounds to capture moods, irregular intervals between pieces
limit their ability to comprehensively capture specific trends.</p>
<p>The compositions provide a sonic commentary on our evolving social
landscape, exploring proximity, contagion, and humour. They mirror
emotional shifts and engagement in trending activities during the
pandemic's early stages, emphasising emotional contagion through empathy
and digital communication. The pieces explore various trends and
behaviours influenced by social media, such as panic buying and DIY
haircare, shedding light on the role of online contagion. The series
balances light-hearted tones and darker themes related to isolation and
trauma, portraying the emotional toll of prolonged social separation,
and changing circumstances.</p>
<p>Playfulness and humour feature prominently, offering solace amidst
challenging emotions and experiences. Absurd elements and surreal
depictions engage the audience and provide relief from pandemic-induced
stress.</p>
<p>Integrating novel interfaces like the <em>GLVD</em> and <em>Muse
2</em> adds a playful dimension, facilitating embodied sound
interactions and enhancing the compositions' distinctiveness.</p>
<p>Where possible, pieces were crafted with low-budget technology,
leveraging available resources and other research strands. The
cost-effective approach reflects the pandemic’s shift from professional
setups to home environments. Intentional use of lower-quality devices
mirrors pandemic themes in compositions. Field recording devices
highlighted the value of simplicity and reduced cognitive load,
underscoring artists' adaptability in adversity and offering lessons for
future creative endeavours during crises.</p>
